                <p>
                    We may occasionally use alphanumeric identifiers (“cookies”) which are transferred to your
                    computer’s hard drive through your web browser to enable our system to recognise your browser when
                    you use the Website and to monitor traffic patterns. Our Website uses cookies to distinguish you
                    from other users of our Website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse
                    our Website and also allows us to improve our Website. You may modify your web browser to prevent it

                    We may use YouTube to host video content. When you view a web page on our site with an embedded
                    YouTube video, YouTube creates at least three cookies: VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE, use_hitbox, and PREF. In
                    some circumstances you may also find an additional GEO cookie. We use the YouTube service as a
                    convenience for our visitors, and we use it on the basis that Google adheres to its privacy
                    policy.<br><br>

                    We use Google Maps on our Locations page to provide detailed information on how to locate

                    Google Maps stores up to four cookies: khcookie, NID, SNID and PREF. We use Google’s interactive
                    maps because we believe they provide a helpful way for our visitors to identify how best to reach
                    us.<br><br>

                <p>
                    Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) also places cookies on
                    your computer, to enable Google to provide us with activity reports relating to the Sites. Google
                    uses this data only to provide us with information on how users use the Sites and does not associate
                    your IP address with any other data held by Google. The information generated by Google cookies
                    about your use of the platform (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by
                    Google on servers in the United States. You may refuse these cookies by selecting the appropriate

                <h3>Google Tag Manager</h3>

                <p>
                    This website also uses Google Tag Manager. This service allows website tags to be managed via an
                    interface. Tags are small elements of code that are used, for example, to measure traffic and
                    visitor behaviour. Google Tag Manager only implements tags. This means that no cookies are used and,
                    as a result, no personal data is recorded. Google Tag Manager initiates other tags which, in turn,
                    may record data. However, Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If deactivation has been
                    performed at a domain or cookie level, this remains in place for all tracking tags if these are
